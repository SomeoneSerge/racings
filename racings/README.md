# racings

This package shall contain the actual application, that is domain model, that is
description of data and constraints.

For now that's to be just a [Cerberus](https://github.com/pyeve/cerberus)-schema
dictionary which'll be fed into [Eve](https://github.com/pyeve/eve).

The actual runnable application resides in [`./racings_app/`](./racings_app/)
